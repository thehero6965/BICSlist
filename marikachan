  "description": "<I’ve gained the ability to see the affection levels of the girl I like.──I don’t have the courage to confess my feelings to my childhood friend, Marika-chan. One day, I made a strong wish upon a shooting star: 'I wish I could understand the feelings of others, like in a dating game.' Then, that wish came true...!?

Floating above the girls in my class are affection meters. While confused by this surreal sight, I decide to check Marika-chan’s meter, only to find it has broken past its limits, turning into a hellish meter...!?

Marika-chan, you don’t like me, so why are you so kind to me...?
──What is Marika-chan’s hidden truth behind her cute façade? Does she really hate me!? Or is it something else...!?>",
